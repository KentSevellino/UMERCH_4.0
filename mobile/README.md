# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### Other setup steps

- To set up ESLint for linting, run `npx expo lint`, or follow our guide on ["Using ESLint and Prettier"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/)
- If you'd like to set up unit testing, follow our guide on ["Unit Testing with Jest"](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/)
- Learn more about the TypeScript setup in this template in our guide on ["Using TypeScript"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)

## Local API integration

The mobile app uses the Laravel API in the sibling `backend` directory.

1. From `backend`, install dependencies and create the local environment:

   ```bash
   composer install
   copy .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

2. Start the API from `backend`:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   ```

3. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `mobile/.env`:

   ```env
   # Web or iOS simulator
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

   # Android emulator
   # EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000/api

   # Physical device: replace the address with the computer's LAN IP
   # EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.x.x:8000/api
   ```

   The mobile app signs in with the email and password created by an admin.
   For a normal user, `POST /api/login` sends a six-digit OTP to that user's
   email, and the app verifies it through `POST /api/verify-otp`. Android
   emulators use `10.0.2.2`; physical devices need the computer's LAN IP.

The existing email login is `POST /api/login` and the product catalog is
`GET /api/products`. OTP delivery also requires valid mail settings in the
backend `.env` file. Product images uploaded through Laravel are returned as
public `image_url` values by the API.

For Gmail OTP delivery, configure the backend with an app password:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_SCHEME=smtps
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=your-sending-account@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-sending-account@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Umerch"
```
